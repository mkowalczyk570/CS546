            <h2>The Pirates of Bilgewater</h2>
            <cite>January 15th, 2023</cite>
            <p>A coastal city which festers with crime. Being a port town
                the more honest denizens of Bilgewater are fishermen, sailors, and the like. Famous for its crime,
                Bilgewater has no shortage of the shady characters who give the city its reputation.

            <h2>A Looming Mountain</h2>
            <cite>March 27th, 2023</cite>
            <p>The very first thing I noticed wasn't the mountains insurmountable size, it was the heat I felt at the base.
               Being the very mountain in which the One Ring was forged, and the only place it could be destroyed,
               this thing packs a serious punch! As we climbed the mountain, it only got hotter and hotter..thankfully
               we a guide with us who knew how to cast magic that would alleviate the heat somewhat. We should really look 
               into that back home!
            </p>
            <p>
                After what felt like an eternity, we finally make it to the very top of the mountain!
                As i peer over the ledge into the center of this massive volcano, I notice just how hot it felt.
                Not even anti-heat magic could combat the wave escaping the mountain's depths.
