                <h3>Documents Ready</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a must for you to take your documents with you on your travels. It is equally
                    important that you do not lose these documents either. The last thing you want
                    to be doing when travelling is scrambling to find them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some common ways people store their documents are in binders, folders, and dedicated 
                    carry-on bags like briefcases. This way can keep all of your documents in one place, 
                    and keep them on hand.

                <h3>Convert your cash</h3>
                <p>
                    While desinations dedicated to tourism will often take your cash the way it is,
                    make sure you convert into one of the local accepted currencies! Your travel funds
                    won't be worth much if the locals don't accept it.

                <h3>Pack Light</h3>
                <p>
                   Traveling all of these places is a lot of fun, but be very careful of over-packing!
                   Along the way you're sure to pick up a few souveniers, so packing a little lighter will help
                   save you some room for them when you go back home!
